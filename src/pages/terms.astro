    <article class="legal-content">

      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Makonome app ("App"), developed by Miro Čosić ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

      <h2>1. The App</h2>
      <p>Makonome is a metronome and practice tracking application for iOS. The App is available in the following tiers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Makonome</strong> – Free, with a 14-day trial of all features</li>
        <li><strong>Makonome Pro</strong> – Unlocked via a one-time in-app purchase</li>
        <li><strong>Makonome Studio</strong> – Unlocked via a one-time in-app purchase (when available)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. License</h2>
      <p>We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on any Apple device you own or control, subject to these Terms and the Apple App Store Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>You may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code</li>
        <li>Use the App for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent</li>
        <li>Use the App in any way that violates applicable law</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Free Trial</h2>
      <p>The App includes a <strong>14-day free trial</strong> during which all features are available at no cost. The trial begins on the date of first launch. After the trial period expires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Core metronome features remain available for free</li>
        <li>Advanced features (Gap Trainer, Tempo Changer, session tracking, and others) require a Makonome Pro or Makonome Studio purchase to continue using</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The trial is provided once per device. We reserve the right to modify trial terms with notice.</p>

      <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>

      <h3>4.1 One-Time Purchases</h3>
      <p>Makonome Pro and Makonome Studio are <strong>one-time, non-consumable</strong> in-app purchases. Once purchased:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The purchase is permanent and does not expire</li>
        <li>It applies to all devices signed in to the same Apple ID</li>
        <li>No recurring charges are applied</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Payment</h3>
      <p>All payments are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not handle or store payment information. Apple's payment terms apply.</p>

      <h3>4.3 Restore Purchases</h3>
      <p>If you reinstall the App or switch devices, you can restore your purchase via the "Restore Purchases" option in the App's settings at no additional charge.</p>

      <h3>4.4 Refunds</h3>
      <p>Refund requests are handled by Apple in accordance with their refund policy. We do not process refunds directly. Visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportaproblem.apple.com</a> to request a refund from Apple.</p>

      <h2>5. Updates</h2>
      <p>We may release updates to the App from time to time. Updates may add, modify, or remove features. We reserve the right to discontinue features with reasonable notice. Purchasing Makonome Pro or Makonome Studio entitles you to all updates within that tier at no additional cost.</p>

      <h2>6. User Data</h2>
      <p>Your practice sessions, settings, and usage data are stored locally on your device. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details on data collection and use.</p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The App, including its design, code, sounds, and content, is owned by Miro Čosić and protected by copyright and intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or brand features.</p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The App is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or bug-free, or that it will meet your specific requirements.</p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or any damages exceeding the amount you paid for the App in the 12 months prior to the claim.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the App ends. Sections 7, 8, 9, and 11 survive termination.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>Republic of Croatia</strong> and applicable European Union regulations.</p>
      <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of <strong>Zagreb, Croatia</strong>, unless otherwise required by applicable EU consumer protection law in your country of residence.</p>
      <p>If you are an EU consumer, you may also use the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a></p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, through an in-app notice. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
